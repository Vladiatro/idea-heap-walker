# idea-heap-walker
This is an educational plugin for profiling Java application, which will help you to find memory leaks.
It has the following set of runtime metrics:
* Object creation place: one can view the stack frame which was when the object was created.
* Object last access time: when one of the object's fields was last time accessed.
These metrics don't work with arrays!

More info you will find on [Wiki](https://github.com/Vladiatro/idea-heap-walker/wiki).
